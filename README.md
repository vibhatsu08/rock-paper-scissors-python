ProjectLog[0] - In this series of ProjectLogs, i will be working on making the Rock Paper Scissors game in Python. The functionality will include, the computer making a choice, the user making a choice, and the score will depend on the outcome. </br>
ProjectLog[1] - The idea is simple, the game will start with the user's response, to either start or not. If yes, the user will be prompted to play his/her move. On the user's input, the computer too, will generate it's move, and based on that, the point will be rewarded to the winner. The user will be allowed to choose the number of rounds for the game. </br>
ProjectLog[2] - Completed the working part of the game. Fully functional and committed on Github repo. Still working on a few bugs related to unexpected inputs. </br>
ProjectLog[3] - Working on the appearance of the final version of the game, for example, the game statements. </br>
ProjectLog[4] - The second last build of the game is ready, with more interesting and better sounding statements. </br>
ProjectLog[5] - Used the 'time' module to add a little delay to the program, achieved this by using the time.sleep() function. </br>
